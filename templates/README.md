# Templates

I am trying to use only HTML in this project. That means I don't get a fragment/partial include or import. So my first attempt will be to write templates in this folder and use either a vim macro or terminal command to copy them into the HTML files am working on.

It could be annoying! If so, I'll figure out what to do about it then.
