## Run locally

- Pull down the repository to your local directory
- In the root of the project, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- While developing locally, you can serve on a local server with :

```bash
npm run serve
```

- Navigate to `http:localhost:8080` in a browser.
- Make a change in a file, save the file, and the change will be reflected in the browser automatically, without a reload.

## Deploy

Currently using the default GitHub Pages basic deployment based on the `main` branch.
