            <h1>Visual Studio Code Setup</h1>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual studio code (VSCode)</a> since 2017. It has been one of my all time favorite text editors. This year I decided to look through my set up and document what I use.</p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<h3>Bracket pair colorizer 2</h3>
<p><img src="./bracket-pair-colorizer-2.png" alt="Bracket pair colorizing nested methods"></p>
<p>This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">extension</a> is great for focusing on what block of code your looking in. I have some of the more verbose settings enabled so that I can see a lot of colors as I navigate through code. This is especially helpful when I have several nested <code>functions</code> or <code>objects</code> within each other.</p>
<h3>Change-case</h3>
<p><img src="./change-case.png" alt="Change-case extension in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>I use this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case">extension</a> via the command palette a lot. Many times I need to transform a pascal case vue.js component into kebab case or vice versa.</p>
<h3>Code spell checker</h3>
<p><img src="./code-spell-checker.png" alt="Code spell checker in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>In the course of typing, I make a lot of spelling mistakes. This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">extension</a> is a life saver. Plus it helps find little bugs due to typos.</p>
<h3>ESLint</h3>
<p><img src="./eslint.png" alt="ESLint extension in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint">ESLint</a> is an essential extension for any JavaScript-based project. Getting all the settings to work are a pain in the ass sometimes, but I couldn't live without it.</p>
<h3>Headwind</h3>
<p><img src="./headwind.png" alt="Headwind in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind">extension</a> helps me align my tailwind classes in the same order without having to thing about it. It doesnâ€™t seem like much, but the consistency of the order without having to think about is awesome.</p>
<h3>Tailwind CSS intelliSence</h3>
<p><img src="./tailwind-css-intellisense.png" alt="Tailwind CSS intelliSence in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss">IntelliSence</a> is a great feature of VSCode. Why not have it know about my Tailwind classes? Very useful for remembering the number differences for spacing and colors.</p>
<h3>Toggle quotes</h3>
<p><img src="./toggle-quotes.png" alt="Toggle quotes in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes">extension</a> seems like it would be native to VSCode along with all the other text transformation tools. I can easily switch between single quotes, double quotes, and back ticks. I even like the default keyboard shortcut <code>control + â€˜</code>.</p>
<h3>Vetur</h3>
<p><img src="./vetur.png" alt="Vetur is the perfect Vue integration extension"></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur">Vetur</a> gives you easy integration with all things Vue in VSCode. It's an essential extension for working with Vue projects. What are you waiting for, download this package right now!</p>
<h3>Vscode-icons</h3>
<p><img src="./vscode-icons.png" alt="Example of vscode-icons for vue, javascript, etc"></p>
<p>I've used the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons">vscode-icon</a> set since I started using Visual Studio Code. I'm so used to them now, I don't want to switch.</p>
<h3>Vue vscode snippets</h3>
<p><img src="./vue-vscode-snippets.png" alt="Vue vscode snippets is the best collection of snippets for the Vue.js language"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets">best snippet</a> package for Vue.js. I sometimes forget the format of certain features because this package has so many good snippets.</p>
<h3>Quick and simple text selection</h3>
<p><img src="./quick-and-simple-text-selection.png" alt="Quick and simple text selection in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>I've used this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbankier.vscode-quick-select">extension</a> so much I thought it was baked into VSCode! It makes selecting text within charactersâ€”think <code>''</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>()</code>â€”a keyboard shortcut away. When I have to do a lot of irregular find and replace tasks, this extension haves my life.</p>
<h3>Text Marker</h3>
<p><img src="./text-marker.png" alt="Text marker extension in the visual studio code store"></p>
<p>Sometimes I need to highlight a piece of code to copy, refactor, delete, etc. This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryu1kn.text-marker">extension</a> does the trick! I try to use it sparingly and clear all highlights when I'm done.</p>
<h2>Font</h2>
<p><img src="./font-victor-mono.png" alt="Victor mono landing page"></p>
<p><a href="https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/">Victor mono</a> was my most used font in 2019. Along with the ligatures and the cursive italic variant, the large x-height makes it easy for me to read.</p>
<p>If it works well for you, consider donating to the creator.</p>
<h3>Italic cursive face not working in VSCode</h3>
<p>(Mar 12, 2020 Update)</p>
<p>There is a bug with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82122">VSCode font rendering for macOS</a>. If this is happening for you, there is a simple work around. Open up the Font Book app, find the Victor Mono font and disable or delete all &quot;oblique&quot; faces. The &quot;oblique&quot; faces were getting applied instead of the &quot;italic&quot; faces.</p>
<p><img src="./disable-oblique-faces.png" alt="Disable oblique faces inside of font book for macOS"></p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>I like color themes. I like having a lot of color themes to choose from. I like light themes for when the sun is out and there is a glare from the window. I like dark themes for the rest of the time.</p>
<p>I tried to stick with one theme for a little while, but I can never make one last. So I keep a handful around and change whenever I feel like itâ€”the <code>cmd + k cmd + t</code> shortcut is handy for quick switching.</p>
<h3>Cobalt2</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-cobalt2.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the cobalt2 theme active"></p>
<p>A classic blue and yellow <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2">theme</a> from <a href="https://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>. I tend to not use it, as I think it's too bright for me. But it has a great highlight search color when doing a &quot;Find in files&quot;.</p>
<h3>Dracula</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-dracula.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the Dracula theme active"></p>
<p>Great dark <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula">theme</a> with purples and pinks. This theme puts a solid vertical pink line between editors when you're in split mode, which I really like. So when I am working with two or three splits for long periods of time, I switch to this theme.</p>
<h3>Monokai pro</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-monokai-pro.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the monokai pro theme active"></p>
<p>This <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode">theme</a> costs money, but there is a free trial. I'd say it is well worth it since it comes with an icon themeâ€”which I don't use. This is my &quot;home base&quot; theme. I might not use it all the time, but I always come back to it eventually.</p>
<h3>Light owl</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-light-owl.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the light owl theme active"></p>
<p>My favorite light theme. Just enough color to be nice, but everything is still readable. It comes with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night Owl</a>, so a two for one situation.</p>
<h3>Night owl</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-night-owl.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the night owl theme active"></p>
<p>A great <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">theme</a> for late night coding. <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/">Sarah Drasner</a> really put a lot of TLC into this theme.</p>
<h3>Overnight Slumber Italics</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-overnight-slumber-italics.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the overnight slumber italics theme active"></p>
<p>I haven't used this theme very much, but I like the peach and purple vibe of <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cev.overnight">this theme</a>. I think I like the &quot;slumber&quot; alternative better than the base theme.</p>
<h3>SynthWave '84</h3>
<p><img src="./theme-synthwave.png" alt="A Vue.js file with the synth wave '84 theme active"></p>
<p>SUPER POP COLORS! When I really need to tell the difference between variables and functions, I turn on <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode">this theme</a>. I don't turn on the custom glow CSS because glow is very distracting to me.</p>
<h2>Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>Next up I'll be writing up what keyboard shortcuts I use and customized to save myself time.</p>
<p>What extensions/themes do you use for VSCode? I'd love to hear about your setup!</p>
